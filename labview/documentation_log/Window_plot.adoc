== Window_plot.vi in detail ==

=== Overview ===

This VI is used to plot data in a window. It is a simple wrapper around the XY Graph control where the signal data is plotted.


=== Elements ===

==== Waveform Graph ====

The waveform graph displays one or more plots of evenly sampled measurements.

===== Properties =====

The waveform graph has the following properties:

- Graph Pallet

The Graph Palette in LabVIEW is a set of tools and options that allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of a graph or chart. It is typically available when you right-click on a graph or chart control in the front panel window link:https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-vision-builder-for-automated-inspection-configuration-help/page/vbai_config/graphpalette.html[Graph Palette Documentation].

Here are some of the features you can access from the Graph Palette:

*Cursor Movement Tool:* No function.

*Zoom:* Zooms in and out of the display.

*Zoom to Rectangle:* Zooms in on a rectangle that you draw on the display area.

*X-zoom:* Zooms in along the x-axis.

*Y-zoom:* Zooms in along the y-axis.

*Zoom In about Point*: Autoscales the chart to fit in the display area.

*Zoom Out about Point:* Zooms in on a point.

*Zoom to Fit:* Zooms out from a point.

*Panning Tool:* Repositions the plot on the display.

- Table of plot legend

The plot legend in LabVIEW is a graphical feature that provides information about the different plots or data series displayed in a graph or chart. It helps users distinguish between multiple data sets and understand what each plot represents. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the table of plot legend in LabVIEW:

Components of the Plot Legend

*Plot Name:* Displays the name or label of each plot. Can be customized to provide meaningful names that describe the data.

*Line Style and Color:* Shows the style (solid, dashed, dotted) and color of the line associated with each plot. Helps visually differentiate between multiple plots on the same graph.

*Point Style:* Indicates the style of data points (circle, square, triangle) used in the plot. Useful for distinguishing between data sets that might otherwise look similar.

*Visibility Toggle:* Allows users to hide or show specific plots without removing the data from the graph. Useful for focusing on specific data sets while temporarily ignoring other

==== Offset Control

The offset control is used to set the offset of the signal.
The first rectangle is used to select the signal to be offset. And follows the slider to set the offset value.

//Cuando se hace uso de este control, las senales se detienen para su interpretacion. La unica manera de reanudar la adquisicion de datos es accesando al menu _Configuration->Local Mode & Refresh Time_. En ese apartado se puede reanudar la adquisicion de datos. Y tambien definir el tiempo de refresco local de la grafica.

When this control is used, the signals stop for interpretation. The only way to resume data acquisition is by accessing the _Configuration->Local Mode & Refresh Time menu_.

.Path to _Local mode & Refresh Time_ option.

In that section, you can resume data acquisition. And also it can be defined the local refresh time of the graph.

==== Get signal from HW

The Get signal from HW is used to get the signal from the hardware.

.Get signal from HW window
image::../documentation_log/graphs_doc_vi/LVtemp20240701194140_11_0.PNG[Get signal from HW in Window_plot.vi]

Features of Get signal from HW:

- Plot window: Shows the current name of the caller window_plot.vi.
- Clone Name: Shows the name of the clone version of Call_signal_fromfile.vi.
- Select signal: Select the signals to be plotted. The signals can be select individually or many at once holding keys _Shift + Click_ or _Ctrl + Click_ .
- Save Signals profile: Save the signals profile in the temporary file that list the signals to be plotted for the next time the window_plot.vi is called.
- Load Signals profile: Load the signals previously saved.

==== Get signal from file

The Get signal from file is used to get the signal from a csv file.

Features of Get signal from HW:

- Plot window: Shows the current name of the window.
- Clone Name: Shows the name of the clone version of the window_plot.vi .
- From file (csv): Select the csv file to be plotted.
- Y data: Select the column to be plotted as Y.
- X data: Select the column to be plotted as X.
